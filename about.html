	    <h1>History and Heritage of the Muslim Modern Academy</h1>
		<p>During the Pakistan period there was no Bengali language educational institution for Bengali boys and girls in Dhaka Cantonment. Cantonment Modern School (now Shaheed Bir Uttam Lt. Anwar Girls College), Ayub Line School (now Shaheed Ramiz Uddin Cantonment School), BAF Shaheen School, Tejgaon and Adamji Cantonment School had the opportunity to study.
		</br>At that time there was no Bengali language educational institution in this area (Kachukhet, Ibrahimpur, Kafrul, Bahantech, Manikdi). In this reality, some eminent educationists, social workers and leading people (who were residents of the area) in the heart of Dhaka Cantonment, Kachukhet area, firmly realized that a Bengali language educational institution is very important for Bengali boys and girls. Among them, Flight Lieutenant (Retd.) ABM Abdur Rashid and some of his close associates unanimously decided to establish a Bengali language school. Flight Lieutenant (Retd.) ABM Abdur Rashid bought some land in Kachukhet area in 1958 and built a house. He retired from the service in 1982.
		</br>The formal educational activities of the school started in these houses in 1973. A committee was formed at the outset to manage the organization smoothly. The school was unanimously named ‘Muslim Modern Academy’ in the discussion of the members present at the first meeting of the committee. This is the name by which the traditional institution has gained its reputation and is moving forward.In the first batch from this school in 198, 9 students participated in the SSC examination and passed with distinction. In 1983, the cantonment authorities gave two acres of land in the name of the school as a playground, emphasizing the importance of sports for the students. As a result, this institution of everyone's life gets Danamela open desert. The board acquired the institution in 1986 in Dhaka Cantonment.
		</br>Area Commander Major General Ataul Hakim Sarwar Hasan, SGP, NDC, AFWC, Director General of PSC, 24 Engineer Construction Brigade, Dhaka Cantonment Dhaka, in 2017-18, is the main patron of the school. The long-standing institution left its shell and was decorated in a modern style.The Department of Military Lands and Cantonments, Cantonment Boards and other agencies as well as the headmaster and other responsible teachers are playing a significant role in all the construction and development work of the school in 2019.</p>
